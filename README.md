# Heriseon "Marketing Masters": HTML and CSS Code Clean-Up

## Project Goal
```
My goal for this project was to make sure all elements of the web page are functioning
properly and to clean up the current code by removing any code that was not necesary,
either because it was repeated on multiple lines or because it could be grouped into
other elements which would simplify the code.

I wanted to make the code clearer for it to be quicker to navigate by orginizing it with
comments and reordering it a more legible fashion. This will help me and future coders to
be more efficient in our work and help us understand the purpose of each section of code
without having to decipher it.

I must include that my goal is NOT to change the layout or the look of the web page, but
to only fix any bugs, and to clean the code to make it easier for future work on it and
to prevent any bugging.

## HTML Improvements

```
- Created more appealing Title
- Broke up code with comments to help understant code
- Inserted more appropriate elements instead of everthing labeled as "div"s
  to help with SEOs and screen readers
- Incerted background image in HTML code by using "src" in stead of bing in the CSS
- Added "alt" to every image in case of image load issues
- Fixed broken link so that it navigates user to propper location on page
```

## CSS Improvements

```
- Added comments to CSS code to make it easier to understand, quicker to navigate, and more
  organized
- Organized CSS in the order of page layout. Starting with global, follwed by elements,
  header, body, background image, columned containers, side bar, then footer
- Trimmed code fat by removing repetitive code and simplifying code elements, applying color
  and fonts in more general elements to apply them to included classed and ids
